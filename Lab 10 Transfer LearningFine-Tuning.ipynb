The datasets recommended below are in the correct format.\n","- Get the CNN working on the provided dataset (bird species classification) before swapping in your own.\n","- For reference on freezing/unfreezing network weights, see [this github gist](https://gist.github.com/jcjohnson/6e41e8512c17eae5da50aebef3378a4c)\n","- Check PyTorch's documentation to learn the difference between `requires_grad=False` and `requires_grad_(False)`.\n","- For training GPT-2, first try the medium-size (355M parameter) model.
